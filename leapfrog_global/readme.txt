This is a project that was done in preparation for meeting the principal of a company to discuss opportunities for us to work together. 
To get an initial sense of the company's product offerings, the company's main product website was scraped, where name and price data for over 400 items
was scraped to a csv file which was then used for data analysis using Pandas. 

This repository will include :
* the codebase for the web scraper that was used to scrape the website (which was written in Python and used the BeautifulSoup Library)
* the csv file that was scraped 
* the Jupyter Notebook on which the data analysis of the product data was done 

The information was scraped at approximately 9pm, 21.12.2002, Singapore time.
