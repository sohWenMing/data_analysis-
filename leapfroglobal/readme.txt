This project was done in preparation to meet with the principal of the company to discuss further possible opportunities in working 
together on her business. In terms of process, the steps taken to get to the findings in the Jupyter notebook were 

1)  understand the layout of the website, and craft a strategy to be able to scrape information off the website 
    http://leapfroglobal.com to better understand what the company does through getting to know the products they sell 
2)  Building the python script to scrape all 40 pages of price data and save to CSV
3)  Cleaning all the data and reformatting price infomration to numeric datatypes to be able to perform anaylysis on dataset
